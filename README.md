About Me

Hey, I’m Jake—marine biologist by training, rum distiller by accident, data nerd by choice. I started this repo because I believe the best graphs don’t just explain—they translate. Whether it’s tracking turtles, decoding distillation runs, or figuring out what whales are up to with a suspiciously high-resolution tag, I’m here for the “aha” moments.

This is where science meets spirits, conservation meets code, and pie charts meet… actual pie (usually rum-soaked). If you like your data visualizations clear, clever, and occasionally fermented, you’re in the right place.

Distill the data. Sip the insights.
