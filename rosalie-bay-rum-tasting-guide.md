# Rosalie Bay Distilling – Rum Tasting Guide

This guide will help you understand how to approach each aspect of the rum tasting experience, providing guidance on what to look for and techniques to enhance your evaluation.

## Preparing for the Tasting

### Before You Begin
- Allow the rum to rest in the glass for 1-2 minutes before evaluation
- Avoid wearing strong perfumes or colognes during tasting
- Clear your palate with water between samples
- Take your time with each sample – rushing reduces perception

### Environmental Factors
- **Time of Day**: Note when you're tasting. Our perception tends to be sharper earlier in the day.
- **Weather**: Humidity and atmospheric pressure can affect aroma volatility and perception.
- **Location**: Your surroundings can influence your experience. Note any environmental aromas.

## Understanding the Evaluation Categories

### Appearance
While not on the form, take a moment to observe:

**Color Intensity**: Rate from 0 (completely clear) to 40 (very dark)

Also note:
- **Viscosity**: Swirl the glass and observe how the rum coats the sides
- **Legs/Tears**: How quickly or slowly do they form and run down the glass?

### Aroma (Nose)
*How to evaluate*: Gently swirl the glass to release aromas. Hold it just below your nose and take a series of short sniffs rather than one deep inhale (which can numb your sense of smell).

*Rating scale (0-10)*: 0 = not detectable, 10 = extremely prominent

*What to look for*:
- **Vanilla**: Sweet, creamy notes associated with oak aging
- **Caramel**: Brown sugar, toffee, butterscotch notes
- **Tropical Fruit**: Mango, banana, pineapple, papaya
- **Citrus**: Orange, lemon, lime, grapefruit
- **Spice**: Cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, allspice
- **Earthy/Funky**: Mushroom, soil, overripe fruit, complexity from fermentation
- **Oak/Wood**: Sawdust, cedar, toasted wood from barrel aging
- **Esters**: Fruity, floral chemical compounds (banana, pear drop, rose)
- **Smoke**: Charred wood, tobacco, toasted notes
- **Lemongrass**: Citrusy, herbal, green grassy notes common in agricole rums

### Taste (Palate)
*How to evaluate*: Take a small sip and let it coat your entire mouth. Note the initial impression, then how flavors develop as you hold it in your mouth.

*Rating scale (0-10)*: 0 = not detectable, 10 = extremely prominent

*What to look for*:
- **Sweetness**: Perceived sugar content (not always actual sugar)
- **Bitterness**: Tannic qualities, sometimes from wood aging
- **Acidity**: Brightness, sharpness, or tartness
- **Astringency**: Drying sensation, sometimes from tannins
- **Spiciness**: Warming, peppery sensations
- **Fruitiness**: Fruit flavors that may differ from aroma
- **Woodiness**: Oak influence, vanilla, tannins
- **Complexity**: Multiple flavor layers that evolve on the palate
- **Balance**: How well all elements work together
- **Mouthfeel**: Texture from thin/watery (1) to thick/viscous (10)

### Finish
*How to evaluate*: After swallowing, note how long flavors persist and how they evolve.

*What to look for*:
- **Length**: How long flavors persist - short (1) to very long (10)
- **Clean/Dirty**: Whether the finish is pure and focused or complex and earthy
- **Evolving Flavors**: New flavors that appear specifically in the finish

### Overall Impressions
- **Preferred Use**: How you'd ideally enjoy this rum (neat, mixed, etc.)
- **Similarity**: What other spirits it reminds you of
- **Personal Rating**: Your subjective enjoyment (1-10)
- **Notable Characteristics**: Anything unique or memorable

## Tasting Techniques

### The Three-Sip Approach
1. **First sip**: Introduces your palate to the spirit
2. **Second sip**: Provides the clearest flavor profile
3. **Third sip**: Reveals subtleties and complexity

### Retronasal Evaluation
After swallowing, exhale gently through your nose to experience "retronasal" aromas, which can reveal different dimensions of the rum.

### Comparative Notes
Consider how each sample compares to others in the lineup. What makes it distinctive?
